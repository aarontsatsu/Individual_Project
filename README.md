# Airline-Route-Finding Program

Description:
The goal of this project is to use basic concepts in java such as classes, efile i/o, hxceptions and algorithms to solve the airline-route finding problem.
Given three files (airports, airlines and routes) with various data, my goal was to read the data into an appropriate data structure and implement an algorithm 
to find the routes that can be taken from one city to another, using airports and their airlines, and routes that they are allowed to use.

How the program runs:
The program takes input from a file (source city and destination city) and passes it as arguments to the graph search algorithm which writes its results to another file.
